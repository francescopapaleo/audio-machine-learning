# Deliverables for the Advanced Topics in SMC second assignment

**1. Classifier implementation with scikit-learn [notebook](./01_log_svm_mlp.ipynb)**
    
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Multi Layer Perceptron with a pipeline to structure categorical and numerical data.

**2. Some more classification tests [notebook](./02_classifier_test.ipynb)**
    
This is a previous iteration than (1.), it shows other preprocessing pipelines that are probably less efficient and more prone to error. 

**3. Some tests with Keras [notebook](./03_keras.ipynb)**

Testing the classification using Keras, experiment with models, loss functions and metrics.
