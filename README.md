## Fundamentals of DSP and Machine Learning

The folder [fundamentals](./fundamentals) contains notebooks to learn the fundamentals of machine learning starting from linear algebra with NumPy and ending with neural networks basic blocks.

## Feature Extractors

The folder [feature_extractors](./feature_extractors) contains notebooks to learn how to extract features from audio files.
