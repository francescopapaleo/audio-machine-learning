K-means clustering aims to partition $n$ observations into $k$ clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. The problem is computationally difficult (NP-hard), however, efficient heuristic algorithms converge quickly to a local optimum. \n",

    "K-nearest neighbours classification (k-NN) is a non-parametric method in which the input consists of the $k$ closest training examples in the feature space. The output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$ is a positive integer, typically small). If $k = 1$, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n"
